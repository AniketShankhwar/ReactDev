  // Using a caret (^) sign means that we can accept minor releases and patch releases, but not a major release when updating our package. e.g. 18.3.1 => 18.3.2
  // Using a tilde (~) sign before our version number means that we can accept only a patch release when updating our package. e.g. 18.3.1 => 18.4.1
  // Using an asterisk (*) means “accept all releases”, but this is not advisable as it will accept major releases and may break our code. e.g. 18.3.1 => 20.4.1
